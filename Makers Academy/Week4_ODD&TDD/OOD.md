# The 4 Principals

- Encapsulation
  Encapsulating methods and variables into a private mode. Deciding how much access to its methods and variable an object wants give to other methods.
  **Public/Private methods and variables**
- Abstraction
  : expose only a **high-level** machanism for using it
  1. It's linked with SRP in the sense one class/object should be designed to do just one thing only, but do it good
  2. An object/class has to clarly state to other objects/classes it's functionality and public methods that can be used to make that class function with other objects.
  3. The public methods which other methods can call but they don't understand how they work or the futher actions/methods the called class will undertake.
  4. The abstarction could be seen as the user interface
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
